# Checkers

1st Period Mobile Application Development 
Team: Patrick Semler and Siddharth Hazari

**Project Goals:**
- To develop an application through React Native that allows users to play in a game of Checkers.
- To allow users to have the option to play against the built in computer opponent.
- To allow two users to have the option to also play a local game of multiplayer. 
- To allow users to be able to win games to receive point rewards. These point rewards are able to go towards in-game cosmetic purchases.

**Architecture/Design:**
- Home/Navigation Screen once the app opens, this screen shows options for starting a new game and choosing opponent (computer/local multiplayer).Screen also shows an option to view the rules of the game and how to play. Screen also shows an in-game store for cosmetic items able to be purchased by the reward points in the game.
- Choosing an option results in a screen with a checkers layout board and the pieces for both players.
- Users are able to move their pieces by the rules of the game and the entire game is played until the app deems a winning scenario by one of the players.
- User is able to receive reward points by playing against the computer opponent and winning. Local multiplayer does not result in point rewards.
- Once a game is over, and the user receives reward points or doesn't, the user is given the option to start a new game or return to the Home/Navigation screen.

**Features:**
- Users are able to drag and move pieces to their positions on moves.
- In-game cosmetics that can allow the user to personalize their experience in the app.
- Computer opponent is designed to analyze the game and make moves to achieve a win.
- Local multiplayer option allows for 2 users to play a game through the same screen/app on the same platform.
